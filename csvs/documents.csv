Ind. 25 HAN MAG,N.A.,N.A.,"This manuscript is a historical chronicle of Sri Lanka compiled by the 
buddhist monk Mahānāma in the 5th century. Written in Pali verse style, 
the Mahāvamsa is at once a chronological record of dynastic succession in
Sri Lanka and a Buddhist history. This work was based on the Dīpavamsa 
(The History of the Island), an older chronicle of Sri Lanka and Buddhism.
It ends with the time of the king Mahāsena, who reigned from the late third
through the early fourth century. The Chūlavamsa (The Little Chronicle) is a
sequel to the Mahāvamsa, continuing the history of Sri Lanka to the 19th 
century. The name Mahāvamsa is often applied to the original Mahāvamsa 
together with its sequel, Chūlavamsa.","I, 395-396","""To the kindness and active interest in our objects of Mr. Wilson, in whose agreeable villa 
at Mootwall [Modara] [...] we spent the last night of our stay at Colombo, we are also indebted 
for a copy, with which he presented us, of the most ancient annals of Ceylon, inscribed with 
an iron graver upon Talipot palm leaves in the highly-esteemed Pali language, and preserved 
between richly-carved boards of the costly wood of the Kalamander tree (Diospyrus Hirsuta). 
This carefully-preserved MS. includes, among others, the celebrated epic poem ""Mahawanso,"" 
(an abbreviation ""Mahantaman Wanso,"" ""Genealogy of mighty men,"")
which recites under 100 heads, and in 9175 verses, the most important events connected 
with the interior constitution and history of the island, as also of all the battles fought 
by the inhabitants in foreign countries from B.C. 543 to the year 1758, A.D."" [I, 395]","NARRATIVE,

Luso, son of Bacchus, conqueror of Portugal) is the work of Portuguese 
literature that has had the greatest circulation in the world. The critical 
revision of the text presents numerous issues, despite the fact that the 
poem was published when the poet was still alive (two editions, without 
significant variants, as early as 1572). It is an epic poem in octaves 
(grouped in 10 cantos) that exalts in the figure of its protagonist, Vasco 
da Gama, the ideals of Portuguese expansionism. The author refers back 
to the heroic-chivalric genre (particularly the Italian one), but the 
historical subject matter is still too determined, so he ends up 
constructing, in an overlapping of planes, two poetic-narrative 
dimensions (one historical and one mythological) that fail to merge 
completely. The poet inserts into the framework of the narrative his 
idyllic dreams and his emotion in front of every light of love and beauty,
the young love of Inês de Castro, the nostalgic shores of the Mondego, 
the monstrous figure of Adamastor (personification of the Cape of 
Storms, later Cape of Good Hope), who tells the sailors of his painful 
love: and over all a varied world of fantasy and poetry, the breath, the 
ardour, the sensual magnificence of nature.
It is worth mentioning that on their next visit to Macao (July 1858) and 
its surroundings, the Novara scientists will visit the ""renowned Camoens
Grotto"" where the poet, ""banished from his native land, wrote 
his Lusiad"" [II, 394].",/,,"NARRATIVE,

the Three Character Classic and the Hundred Family Surnames, it formed

expression of the Puritan religious outlook and a great allegorical tale. It 
was published by Nathaniel Ponder in 1678. Because it recapitulates in 
symbolic form the story of Bunyan’s own conversion, there is an intense,
life-or-death quality about Christian’s pilgrimage to the Heavenly City. 
It was instantly popular with all social classes upon its publication, though
it was perhaps the last great expression of the folk tradition of the common
people before the divisive effects of modern enlightened education began 
to be felt. William C. Burns, a presbyterian missionary in China, while in
Xiamen, began to translate Pilgrim’s Progress, the book that had meant so 
much to him as a boy. This edition became quite popular, partly because
it was illustrated by a Scottish artist who took great pains to draw 
the Chinese dress accurately.","II, 367-368","""Among the various scientific objects recommended as important objects of inquiry to the

Chinese history. It is traditionally attributed to a writer with the surname 
of Guliang in the disciple tradition of Zixia, but versions of his name vary and
there is no definitive way to date the text. Although it may be based in part
on oral traditions from as early as the Warring States period (475–221 BCE),
the first references to the work appear in the Han dynasty, and the peak of 
its influence was the 1st century BCE. Along with the Zuo Zhuan and 
Gongyang Zhuan, the work is one of the Three Commentaries on the 
Spring and Autumn Annals. Written in question and answer style, the work 
covers the period between the first year of State of Lu ruler Duke Yin of Lu
(722 BCE) and the fourteenth year of his later counterpart Duke Ai of Lu 
(481 BCE). It is written as a didactic explanation of the subtle political and 
social messages of the Spring and Autumn Annals and is an important 
book for the study of the development of Confucianism from the Warring
States period through the Han dynasty.","II, 418-419","""We were conveyed within the lofty, gloomy 'enceinte' of the walls in the sedan-chair of

Commentaries on the Spring and Autumn Annals. In particular, 
Gongyang Zhuan is a central work to New Text Confucianism, which 
advocates Confucius as an institutional reformer instead of a respected 
scholar, and Chunqiu as an embodiment of Confucius' holistic vision on 
political, social, and moral issues instead of a merely chronicle. It works 
with a question-and-answer pattern to explain the political meaning of a 
certain event or action. All explanations fit into the Confucian concept of 
how an ideal government, based on ritual and etiquette, should be. ","II, 418-419","""We were conveyed within the lofty, gloomy 'enceinte' of the walls in the sedan-chair of

Chinese text that contains anecdotes of political manipulation and warfare 
during the Warring States period (5th to 3rd centuries BC). It is an important
text of the Warring States Period as it describes the strategies and political 
views of the School of Diplomacy and reveals the historical and social 
characteristics of the period. It recounts the history of the Warring States 
from the conquest of the Fan clan by the Zhi clan in 490 BC up to the failed
assassination of Qin Shi Huang by Gao Jianli in 221 BC. The chapters take
the form of anecdotes meant to illustrate various strategies and tricks 
employed by the Warring States. With the focus thus being more on 
providing general political insights than on presenting the whole history of
the period, there is no stringent year-by-year dating such as that found in
the preceding Spring and Autumn Annals. Stories are sorted 
chronologically by under which ruler they take place, but within the reign 
of a single king there is no way to tell if the time elapsed between two 
anecdotes is a day or a year. The book comprises approximately 
120,000 words, and is divided into 33 chapters and 497 sections.","II, 367","""Among the various scientific objects recommended as important objects of inquiry to the
members of the Expedition, during their visit to China, by the renowned sinologue Dr. Pfitzmaier, 
was the obtaining of rare Chinese books, and the elucidation of certain ethnographic and 
linguistic questions. Whatever was achieved by us in throwing light upon these matters is due 
in great measure to the cordial reception with which we were received by men of science resident

massive Chinese leishu encyclopedia compiled by a team of scholars from
977 to 983. It was commissioned by the imperial court of the Song dynasty

volumes and 55 sections, which consisted of about 4.7 million Chinese 
characters. It included citations from about 2,579 different kinds of 
documents spanning from books, poetry, odes, proverbs, steles to
miscellaneous works. After its completion, the Emperor Taizong is said to 
have finished reading it within a year, going through 3 volumes per day. It is
considered one of the Four Great Books of Song. The team who compiled 
it includes: Tang Yue (湯悅), Zhang Wei (張洎), Xu Xuan (徐鉉), 
Song Bai (宋白), Xu Yongbin (徐用賓), Chen E (陳鄂), Wu Shu (吳淑), 
Shu Ya (舒雅), Lü Wenzhong (吕文仲), Ruan Sidao (阮思道),
