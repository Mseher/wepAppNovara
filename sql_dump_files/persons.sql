The first dance they performed they called \" Ukutenga.\" Six handsomely-built dancers advanced, whilst about thirty men closed in a circle around them, and, by their howlings and clapping of hands, formed as it were a musical accompaniment to this singular performance. The dancers sighed, groaned, hissed, and made the most extravagant grimaces and contortions, in order to arouse in themselves an artificial excitement. One, a lad twelve years of age, engaged so earnestly in the sports, that he perspired from his whole body. There is another dance, called \" Tklombo,\" performed in the presence of diseased persons whilst the quack doctor practises his deceptive remedies; and a third, called \"Umduta,\" which is only practised at weddings and other festive occasions. This last seemed to be the most characteristic. The semi-nude, slender men hopped, their arms clung together, in ranks of six, hissing with scorn, occasionally uttering a cry, then suddenly separating and marching one after the other in slow time, in a  circle, uttering the most singular sounds. Now they bent forward the whole upper part of the body, and then back again, each of them making the same violent gestures as in the former dance, and pronouncing some words to excite their companions, such as, \" Be active I\" \" Be alert!\" until they all trembled and became  fearfully and feverishly excited.

Pi-Kwei\'s legacy lies in his efforts to navigate the challenges of this turbulent period, which saw a shift in the balance of power between China and the West.

He was appointed immigration agent for New South Wales in 1847, having become Consul for the City of Hamburg a year earlier, and left for Frankfurt with his family in February 1848. On the journey he drafted the manuscript for his Australien und seine Vortheile fiir Auswanderer (Australia and its advantages for emigrants), which proved an effective tool for attracting German migrants. There was no shortage of applicants and the first ship with ‘bounty migrants’, the Beulah, sailed from London on 10 December. Four more ships left from London in 1849, but as Kirchner had by now reached agreement with the Hamburg shipowner Johann Caesar Godeffroy, all subsequent emigration under his scheme left from Hamburg. The bulk of this first wave of migrants came from the southwestern states — Hesse, Baden and Wiirttemberg — where times were particularly hard.

One of these political offenders, named Longomasino, has to thank the visit of the Austrian frigate to Papeete for his restoration to liberty.

[...] If we understood matters aright, Longomasino, in the course of his juridical labours, had been able to do many a good turn to the Catholic bishop of Tahiti in his dispute with the French administration, and it was therefore less sympathy with the unfortunate political convict than the desire to play an adversary a trick by depriving him of an able adherent, which ind uced the Governor to ask our Commodore permission to give a free passage to Longomasino, who had been condemned to transportation for life.

Nothing daunted by the fulmination of this penalty, the excellent old gentleman is prosecuting his researches yet further, and is energetically defending his principles; and what is still more surprising, he has anything but fallen off in public estimation in consequence. This is due to the fact that, unlike the female population, the Peruvians are very tolerant in religious matters, and rather averse from those pre-disposed to spiritual matters, whence there results the very mall influence of the Peruvian clergy, everywhere visible, and the obstinate virulent enmity with which also, since the Spanish yoke was cast off, the priestly party oppose the progress of liberal ideas. This feeling is moreover powerfully aided by the  hastly testimony of history, that it was the monks who first introduced the rack and the Inquisition into the country. Father Vigil received me with much cordiality, and we had a long talk upon a variety of subjects. At last it turned upon his own well-nown work, and the painful position in which he felt himself with respect to the See of Rome. This was the most interesting portion of our conversation. \" It is not Catholicism that has made the majority of Catholic nations lag so woefully in the career of progress,\" exclaimed the venerable priest, \" but that which Catholicism has suffered to be mixed up with it,—the Inquisition and Monasticism.

On reaching the station where he was to pass the night, Mr. Campbell, though mounted on an excellent animal, found himself greatly fatigued; the guide, on the other hand, after he had stood on his head for a few minutes* and had drank a glass of brandy, set off without further delay on his homeward journey!! [...] In April, 1859, Mr. Campbell despatched a native from La Paz to Tacna, a distance of 249 English miles, which  the Indian accomplished in four days. He rested one day at Tacna, and set off the following morning on his return journey, in the course of-which he had to cross a pass 13,000 feet in height. It would seem that throughout the whole of this immense journey on foot, he followed the Indian custom of taking no other sustenance than a little roasted maize and coca leaves, which he carried in a little pouch at his side, and chewed from time to time. Like other experienced travellers, Mr. Campbell, who has lived over 14 years in Bolivia, is of opinion that a moderate use of coca exercises no prejudicial influence upon the general health, but simply tends to make the Indian races of the higher regions of the Andes more capable of continued laborious work. Many coca-chewers attain a great age, and Mr. Campbell knew one such, who had taken part in the insurrection of Tupac-Amaru in 1781, and at the time of my visit, 1859, was still in full possession of all his faculties.

The number of slaves in Danish colonies was at all times very small, and their manumission consequently more easy. Nevertheless the mode adopted in getting rid of the evil is deserving of attention and imitation. The duty of labouring does not cease with the means of compelling it. Slaves emancipated by the Danish Government may spend the wages they receive for their labour at their own discretion, and are permitted to change masters at pleasure, but they cannot quit their former employer till they have found a fresh one. The rate of wages at St. Thomas is pretty high, and the black population, who form the largest contingent of the labouring population, not only finds constant occupation, but is remarkably well paid besides. The negroes on this island are, however, very handy and quick, thanks to the constant intercourse with foreign nations. Many of them speak several languages fluently, and a German traveller who visits the island for the first time is apt to be not a little surprised at finding himself addressed in his mother-tongue by a swarthy son of Africa\" (III, 442-443).', '', 0, 0),
